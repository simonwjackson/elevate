## General Questions

#### How does Moonbeam differ from Moonlight?

Moonbeam is a small wrapper around the Moonlight streaming client. It automates many of the settings and optimizations that users would otherwise have to configure manually. Moonbeam also adds quality of life features like auto reconnect, and fast failing on low quality networks.

## When to Choose Moonbeam


Choose Moonbeam over standard Moonlight when you:

- Want a hassle-free, optimized streaming experience.
- Frequently switch between different networks or connection types
- Use a portable Linux device with lower system resources
- Need more granular control over streaming parameters

## When to Stick with Standard Moonlight

While Moonbeam offers numerous advantages, there might be scenarios where standard Moonlight is preferable:

- You're using a non-Linux platform
- Only streaming to other devices on the same local network.


#### Is Moonbeam compatible with all Linux distributions?

Moonbeam is compatible with practically all modern Linux distributions. As long as your distribution can run Moonlight, it should be able to run Moonbeam.

#### Do I need special hardware to use Moonbeam?

The hardware requirements for Moonbeam are the same as those for Moonlight. If your system can run Moonlight, it can run Moonbeam.

#### Can I use Moonbeam on non-Linux systems?

Currently, Moonbeam is built specifically for Linux systems and is not available for other operating systems. Support for non-Linux systems is unlikely to be added in the near future.

## Setup and Installation

#### How do I set up Sunshine on my host PC?

For detailed instructions on setting up Sunshine on your host PC, please refer to the [official Sunshine documentation](https://docs.lizardbyte.dev/projects/sunshine/en/latest/about/setup.html).

#### Can I use Moonbeam with NVIDIA GeForce Experience instead of Sunshine?

While Moonbeam is technically compatible with any host setup that works with Moonlight, [NVIDIA dropped support for GeForce Experience game streaming](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-docs/wiki/NVIDIA-GameStream-End-Of-Service-Announcement-FAQ) in February 2023.

#### Why does Moonbeam say Sunshine is not available?

Moonbeam displays this message when it can't establish a connection to Sunshine on your host PC. This could happen for several reasons:

<Steps>

1. Sunshine is not running on your host PC.
2. Your host PC is turned off or not connected to the network.
3. There's a firewall blocking the connection (port 47989 needs to be open).
4. Network issues are preventing communication between your client device and host PC.
5. Sunshine is misconfigured on the host PC.

</Steps>

To resolve this, first ensure Sunshine is running on your host PC. Then, check your network connectivity and firewall settings. Make sure port 47989 is open for both TCP and UDP traffic. If the problem persists, try restarting Sunshine and/or your host PC.

## Misc

#### Can I use Moonbeam to stream non-game applications?

Most installations of Sunshine have a "Desktop" mode preconfigured, which allows you to stream your entire desktop. This enables you to use any application on your host PC through Moonbeam.

#### How does Moonbeam handle different network conditions?

Moonbeam is designed to adapt to various network conditions automatically. For a detailed explanation of how Moonbeam optimizes streaming based on your network, please refer to the [Network Considerations](/troubleshooting/understanding-network-speed-tests/) guide.

#### What does the "dry run" mode do and when should I use it?

Dry run mode allows you to see what settings Moonbeam would use without actually starting a stream. It's useful for testing configurations or debugging issues. For more information, check out the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) guide.

#### Where can I find Moonbeam's log files for debugging?

Moonbeam's log files are located at `/tmp/moonbeam.log`. These logs can be very helpful when troubleshooting issues or reporting bugs.

## Advanced Usage

#### Is it possible to use Moonbeam in scripts or automation?

Yes, Moonbeam can be easily integrated into scripts or automation workflows. For examples and best practices, please see the [Scripting with Moonbeam](/advanced-usage/scripting/) guide.

#### Are there any plans for future features in Moonbeam?

While Moonbeam is mostly feature-complete, there are a few experimental features that are being considering for future releases. Stay tuned to the GitHub repository for updates and announcements.

## Compatibility

#### Can I use Moonbeam on a Steam Deck?

Yes, Moonbeam works on the Steam Deck, just as Moonlight does. In fact, Moonbeam is especially useful for portable devices like the Steam Deck, as it can automatically optimize streaming settings for varying network conditions.

#### Is Moonbeam compatible with cloud gaming services?

No, Moonbeam (like Moonlight) is designed as a self-hosted solution for game streaming. It's not compatible with commercial cloud gaming services.
