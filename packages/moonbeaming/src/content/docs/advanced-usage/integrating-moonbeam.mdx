This section covers several example integrations.

:::note
The examples in this section are not exclusive to Moonbeam and might also work with the standard Moonlight application. However, Moonbeam offers additional features that can further optimize these integrations.

## Gamescope Integration

When you run Gamescope alongside Moonbeam, you can enjoy the following benefits:

### Moonbeam: Client-side Benefits
- Save bandwidth: Stream at a lower resolution and Gamescope will upscale them with improved visuals.
- Increase FPS: The reduced bandwith from a lower resolution may allow for a bump in FPS.

### Sunshine: Host-side Benefits
- Save bandwidth: You could reduce the resolution of the game running on the host. Useful for hosts who may have data caps or transfer limitis.
- Older hardware: Lower resolutions allow some games to run smoother on older hardware. 
- Increase FPS: The reduced bandwith from a lower resolution may allow for a bump in FPS.

Use Gamescope with Moonbeam:

   <Tabs>
   <TabItem label="FidelityFX Super Resolution">

   This command upscales with FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling enabled. 

   ```bash
   nix run nixpkgs#gamescope -- \
   -f \
   -w 1280 \
   -h 720 \
   -F fsr -- \
   moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-resolution 720p --priority fps
   ```
   :::tip[GPU Compatibility]
   FSR works with virtually any GPU, providing improved image quality and performance across a wide range of hardware.
   :::

   ###### Gamescope

   - `-f`: Enables fullscreen mode
   - `-w 1280 -h 720`: Sets gamescope internal resolution to 720p (1280x720)
   - `-F fsr`: Enables FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling

   ###### Moonbeam

   - `--max-resolution 720p`: limits the stream resolution to 720p
   - `--priority fps`: Prioritizes frame rate over image quality

   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="NVIDIA Image Scaling">
   This command upscales with NIS (NVIDIA Image Scaling) upscaling enabled. 

   ```bash
   nix run nixpkgs#gamescope -- \
   -f \
  -w 1280 \
   -h 720 \
   -F nis -- \
   moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-resolution 720p --priority fps
   ```

   :::tip[GPU Compatibility]

   :::

   ###### Gamescope

   - `-f`: Enables fullscreen mode
   - `-w 1280 -h 720`: Sets gamescope internal resolution to 720p (1280x720)
   - `-F nis`: Enables NVIDIA Image Scaling (NIS) for upscaling

   ###### Moonbeam

   - `--max-resolution 720p`: limits the stream resolution to 720p
   - `--priority fps`: Prioritizes frame rate over image quality
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Pixel Perfect">

   This command attempts to preserve pixel-perfect scaling

   ```bash
   nix run nixpkgs#gamescope -- \
   -f \
   -w 1280 \
   -h 720 \
   -S fit \
   -F nearest \
   -- moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-resolution 720p --priority resolution
   ```

   ###### Gamescope

   - `-f`: Enables fullscreen mode
   - `-w 1280 -h 720`: Sets gamescope internal resolution to 720p (1280x720)
   - `-S fit`: Uses fit scaling, which scales the image to fit the output while preserving aspect ratio
   - `-F nearest`: Uses nearest-neighbor filtering for scaling, which helps preserve pixel-perfect appearance 

   ###### Moonbeam

   - `--max-resolution 720p`: limits the stream resolution to 720p
   - `--priority resolution`: prioritizes image quality over frame rate

   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

:::tip
The double dash (`--`) separates Gamescope options from the Moonbeam command, ensuring each application correctly interprets its own options.

## Gamemode Integration

Gamemode is a daemon that can optimize your system for gaming.

Use Gamemode with Moonbeam:

```bash
nix run nixpkgs#gamemoderun -- moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>
```

This command applies Gamemode optimizations while running your Moonbeam stream.


:::caution
Gamemode may conflict with some power management tools. Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility with your system.
:::

## Integration with Desktop Environments

You can create desktop shortcuts or menu entries for quick access to your favorite games and applications through Moonbeam. 

> This method works for both Moonbeam and standard Moonlight.

Create a `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/`:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Stream Game
Exec=moonbeam stream <HOST> "My Favorite Game"
Type=Application
Categories=Game;
```

This creates a menu entry that launches your specified game through Moonbeam when clicked.

:::note
Replace `<HOST>` and `"My Favorite Game"` with your actual host and game name.
