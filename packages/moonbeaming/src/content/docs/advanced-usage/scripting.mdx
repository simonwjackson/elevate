description: Learn how to create scripts and advanced integrations with Moonbeam to customize your game streaming experience
---

You can create shell scripts that use Moonbeam to automate various aspects of your streaming setup. Here are several creative examples:

### Night Mode Streaming 

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S nix shell nixpkgs#bash nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#brightnessctl nixpkgs#redshift nixpkgs#moonbeam -c bash

# night_mode__streaming.sh
current_hour=$(date +%H)

if (( current_hour >= 22 || current_hour < 6 )); then
  # Night mode

  # Lower brightness
  brightnessctl set 50%

  # Warmer colors
  redshift -O 3500

  moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-bandwidth 5000
else
  moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>
fi
```

This script adjusts streaming settings based on the time of day, potentially reducing eye strain during night hours and limiting the bitrate to 5000 kbps during nighttime streaming.

### Multi-game launcher

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S nix shell nixpkgs#bash nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#moonbeam -c bash

# multi_game_launcher.sh
games=("Game 1" "Game 2" "Game 3" "Game 4")

echo "Select a game to launch:"
select game in "${games[@]}"; do
  case $game in
    "Game 1") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 1" --priority resolution ;;
    "Game 2") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 2" --priority fps --max-fps 120 ;;
    "Game 3") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 3" --max-resolution 4K --fps 60 ;;
    "Game 4") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 4" ;;
    *) echo "Invalid selection" ;;
  esac
  break
done
```

This script presents a menu of games, each with customized streaming settings.

### Conditional Streaming Settings

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S nix shell nixpkgs#bash nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#moonbeam -c bash

# adaptive-moonbeam.sh
HOST="my-gaming-pc"
APP="$1"

# Check if we're on battery power
on_battery() {
    cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status | grep -q "Discharging"
}

# Set streaming options based on power status
if on_battery; then
    OPTIONS="--max-resolution 720p --max-fps 30 --max-bitrate 5000"
else
    OPTIONS="--max-resolution 1080p --max-fps 60 --max-bitrate 20000"
fi

moonbeam stream "$HOST" "$APP" $OPTIONS
```

This script adjusts streaming quality based on whether the device is running on battery power.

## Advanced Integration Examples

Here are some more advanced integration examples that showcase Moonbeam's versatility:

### Game Streaming Session Time Tracker and Limiter

This script uses the `timewarrior` time tracking tool to monitor your gaming sessions and limit them to a specified duration.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S nix shell nixpkgs#bash nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#moonbeam nixpkgs#timewarrior -c bash

# game_session_tracker.sh
MAX_SESSION_TIME=120 # Maximum session time in minutes

start_time=$(date +%s)

# Start time tracking
timew start "Gaming Session"

# Start the game stream
moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> &
pid=$!

while true; do
    current_time=$(date +%s)
    elapsed_time=$((current_time - start_time))
    
    if [ $elapsed_time -ge $((MAX_SESSION_TIME * 60)) ]; then
        echo "Session time limit reached. Stopping the stream."
        kill $pid
        break
    fi
    
    sleep 60 # Check every minute
done

# Stop time tracking
timew stop

echo "Gaming session ended. Total time: $(timew summary)"
```

This script will start a Moonbeam stream, track the session time using timewarrior, and automatically stop the stream after the specified time limit.

### Moonbeam Integration with Home Automation Systems

This example integrates Moonbeam with Home Assistant, a popular home automation platform, to control your gaming environment.

:::note
This is a contrived example to demonstrate the potential integration of Moonbeam with home automation systems. In practice, the specific implementation would depend on your home automation setup, available devices, and personal preferences.
:::

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env -S nix shell nixpkgs#bash nixpkgs#coreutils nixpkgs#moonbeam -c bash

# gaming_environment.sh
HASS_URL="http://homeassistant.local:8123"
HASS_TOKEN="your_long_lived_access_token"

# Function to call Home Assistant API
call_hass_service() {
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HASS_TOKEN" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "$2" \
         "$HASS_URL/api/services/$1"
}

# Set up gaming environment
call_hass_service "light/turn_on" '{"entity_id": "light.gaming_room", "brightness": 128, "rgb_color": [255,0,0]}'
call_hass_service "climate/set_temperature" '{"entity_id": "climate.gaming_room", "temperature": 22}'

# Start the game stream
moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>

# Reset environment after gaming
call_hass_service "light/turn_on" '{"entity_id": "light.gaming_room", "brightness": 255, "rgb_color": [255,255,255]}'
call_hass_service "climate/set_temperature" '{"entity_id": "climate.gaming_room", "temperature": 24}'
```

This script adjusts your room's lighting and temperature before starting a game stream, and resets them after you're done gaming.
