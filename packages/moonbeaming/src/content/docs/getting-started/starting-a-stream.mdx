:::note
For bandwidth detection, you must run [`iperf3`](/troubleshooting/understanding-network-speed-tests/#speed-test-failures) on the host. Otherwise, you'll need to add [`--max-bandwidth <kbps>`](/core-settings/bitrate) to the command.

To start streaming a game or application with Moonbeam, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Type the basic Moonbeam streaming command:

   ```bash
   moonbeam stream <host> "<application name>"
   ```

   Replace `<host>` with the name or IP address of your gaming PC, and `<application name>` with the exact name of the game or application you want to stream.

3. Press Enter to execute the command.

</Steps>

Here's an example of a basic Moonbeam command:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyGamingPC "Cyberpunk 2077"
```

This command tells Moonbeam to start streaming the game "Cyberpunk 2077" from the computer named "MyGamingPC".

:::tip[Auto Mode]
If you don't specify any options, Moonbeam will automatically determine the best settings based on your current network and system conditions. This "auto mode" is great for most situations.

:::caution
Make sure to enclose the app name in quotes if it contains spaces. For example: "Grand Theft Auto V"

## Basic Command Structure

The basic structure of a Moonbeam command is as follows:

```bash
moonbeam [options] stream <host> <app>
```

Let's break down each part of this command:

- `moonbeam`: The name of the application you're running.
- `[options]`: Optional flags and parameters that modify how Moonbeam behaves (we'll cover these in the [Core Settings](/core-settings/resolution) section).
- `stream`: The action you want Moonbeam to perform, telling it to start a streaming session.
- `<host>`: The hostname or IP address of the computer you want to stream from.
- `<app>`: The name of the game or application you want to stream.

## Streaming with Optimized Settings

By default, Moonbeam optimizes your streaming settings. It automatically adjusts resolution, FPS, and bitrate based on your current network conditions and system capabilities.

When you run the basic streaming command without additional options:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyGamingPC "Red Dead Redemption 2"
```

Moonbeam performs the following steps:
<Steps>

1. Checks if Sunshine is available on your host PC.

2. Detects your display resolution and refresh rate.

3. Measures your network speed and latency.

4. Chooses optimal streaming settings based on the collected data.

5. Starts the stream with these optimized settings.

</Steps>

## Streaming Non-Game Applications

Moonbeam isn't limited to just games. You can stream any application that's available on your host PC. This is useful for remote work or accessing resource-intensive applications.

Sunshine, by default, includes an entry called "Desktop" which allows you to stream your entire desktop. You can use this to access any application on your host PC:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyWorkPC "Desktop"
```

For specific applications, you can add them to Sunshine and stream them directly. For example, to stream a design application:

```bash
moonbeam stream WorkStation "Adobe Photoshop"
```

:::tip
Using the "Desktop" option gives you flexibility to switch between different applications during your streaming session without needing to restart the stream.

## Troubleshooting Common Streaming Issues

If you encounter issues while trying to stream, try these quick fixes:

<Steps>

1. **Connection Problems**: Ensure both your local device and host PC are connected to the network.

2. **Firewall Setings**: Ensure that your firewall on both the host and client machines allows Moonbeam to communicate over the network. 


4. **Host Not Responding**: Verify that Sunshine or GeForce Experience is running on your host PC.

5. If problems persist, check the Moonbeam logs for more detailed error information. See the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) section for more advanced problem-solving techniques.
