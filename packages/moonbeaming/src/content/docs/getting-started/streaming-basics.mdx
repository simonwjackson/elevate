Moonbeam uses a straightforward command-line interface to provide an optimized game streaming experience. This guide will walk you through the basic command structure and how to start streaming your favorite games and applications.

## Basic Command Structure

The basic structure of a Moonbeam command is as follows:

```bash
moonbeam [options] stream <host> <app>
```

Let's break down each part of this command:

- `moonbeam`: The name of the application you're running.
- `[options]`: Optional flags and parameters that modify how Moonbeam behaves (we'll cover these in the [Configuration Options](/configuration-options) section).
- `stream`: The action you want Moonbeam to perform, telling it to start a streaming session.
- `<host>`: The hostname or IP address of the computer you want to stream from.
- `<app>`: The name of the game or application you want to stream.

## Starting a Stream

To start streaming a game or application with Moonbeam, follow these steps:

<Steps>

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where Moonbeam is installed (if necessary).

3. Type the basic Moonbeam streaming command:

   ```bash
   moonbeam stream <host> "<application name>"
   ```

   Replace `<host>` with the name or IP address of your gaming PC, and `<application name>` with the exact name of the game or application you want to stream.

4. Press Enter to execute the command.

</Steps>

Here's an example of a basic Moonbeam command:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyGamingPC "Cyberpunk 2077"
```

This command tells Moonbeam to start streaming the game "Cyberpunk 2077" from the computer named "MyGamingPC".

:::tip[Auto Mode]
If you don't specify any options, Moonbeam will automatically determine the best settings based on your current network and system conditions. This "auto mode" is great for most situations.

:::caution
Make sure to enclose the app name in quotes if it contains spaces. For example: "Grand Theft Auto V"
:::

## Streaming with Optimized Settings

By default, Moonbeam optimizes your streaming settings. It automatically adjusts resolution, FPS, and bitrate based on your current network conditions and system capabilities.

When you run the basic streaming command without additional options:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyGamingPC "Red Dead Redemption 2"
```

Moonbeam performs the following steps:

1. Checks if Sunshine is available on your host PC.
1. Detects your display resolution and refresh rate.
2. Measures your network speed and latency.
3. Chooses optimal streaming settings based on the collected data.
4. Starts the stream with these optimized settings.

For more information on how Moonbeam optimizes your stream, check out the [Auto Mode](/auto-mode) section.

## Streaming Non-Game Applications

Moonbeam isn't limited to just games. You can stream any application that's available on your host PC. This is useful for remote work or accessing resource-intensive applications.

Sunshine, by default, includes an entry called "Desktop" which allows you to stream your entire desktop. You can use this to access any application on your host PC:

```bash
moonbeam stream MyWorkPC "Desktop"
```

For specific applications, you can add them to Sunshine and stream them directly. For example, to stream a design application:

```bash
moonbeam stream WorkStation "Adobe Photoshop"
```

:::tip
Using the "Desktop" option gives you flexibility to switch between different applications during your streaming session without needing to restart the stream.

For information on how to add custom applications to Sunshine, check out the [Sunshine Configuration](/sunshine-configuration) section.
## Troubleshooting Common Streaming Issues

If you encounter issues while trying to stream, try these quick fixes:

<Steps>

1. **Connection Problems**: Ensure both your local device and host PC are connected to the network.

2. **Application Not Found**: Double-check the spelling and capitalization of the application name.

3. **Poor Performance**: If the stream quality is poor, try lowering the resolution or FPS:

   ```bash
   moonbeam --resolution 720p --fps 30 stream MyGamingPC "Demanding Game"
   ```

4. **Host Not Responding**: Verify that [Sunshine](/prerequisites#sunshine-setup) or GeForce Experience is running on your host PC.

5. If problems persist, check the Moonbeam logs for more detailed error information. See the [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) section for more advanced problem-solving techniques.

</Steps>

:::caution[Firewall Settings]
Ensure that your firewall on both the host and client machines allows Moonbeam to communicate over the network. For more information on network configuration, see the [Network Considerations](/network-considerations) section.
