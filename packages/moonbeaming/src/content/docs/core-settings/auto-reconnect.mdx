Moonbeam can automatically restore your streaming session if faced with a temporary network disruption. 

## Enabling Auto-reconnect

To enable the auto-reconnect functionality, add the `--reconnect` flag when launching Moonbeam:

```bash
moonbeam --reconnect stream MyHost "My Game"
```

## How Auto-reconnect Works

When auto-reconnect is enabled, Moonbeam will:

<Steps>

1. Connect to the host

2. During the stream, detect any disconnection event.

3. Reevaluate the connection quality to the host.

4. Adjust streaming parameters (if necessary).

6. Attempt to resume the streaming session.

</Steps>

:::tip
Auto-reconnect is especially useful for portable PC gaming devices or laptops on unstable/mobile internet connections.

## Limitations and Considerations

While auto-reconnect is a useful feature in many situations, it's important to understand its limitations:

- <Badge text="Game Behavior" variant="note" /> Games can continue to run on the host regardless of whether this feature is enabled. Upon disconnect, Sunshine will send a `controller disconnection event` to the host. However, not every game will respond the same way to this event. Check your game's settings for an option to pause when a controller is disconnected.

- <Badge text="Resumption Issues" variant="caution" /> Some games may not properly resume after reconnection. A common issue is that controller input may not work until the game is restarted.

## Best Practices

To make the most of the auto-reconnect feature:

1. Ensure your host computer is set to remain awake and doesn't enter sleep mode. Check out [Gamemode Integration](/advanced-usage/integrating-moonbeam/#gamemode-integration)
2. For critical gaming sessions, consider using a wired connection on both the host and client side.
3. If you experience frequent disconnections, try lowering your stream quality settings.

:::caution
While auto-reconnect can help maintain your session, it's not a substitute for a stable network connection. For the best experience, always try to use a reliable internet connection.
