## Setting Up Nix Flakes

Flakes ensure a consistent environment across different systems. Here's how to enable them:

<Steps>

1. Edit your Nix configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nix/nix.conf
   ```

2. Add or modify the following line:

   ```
   experimental-features = nix-command flakes
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the editor.

4. Restart the Nix daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nix-daemon
   ```

</Steps>

## Verifying Flakes Setup

To verify that Flakes are properly set up, you can run a simple Flake command:

```bash
nix flake --version
```

If Flakes are correctly enabled, you should see output indicating the Nix version with Flake support.
