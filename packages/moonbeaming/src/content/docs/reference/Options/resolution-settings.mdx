Resolution settings play a crucial role in determining the visual quality of your game stream through Moonlight. Moonbeam provides various options to configure the resolution, allowing you to optimize the stream based on your network conditions and display capabilities.

:::tip
If you're unsure about your network conditions or experiencing inconsistent performance, try running Moonbeam without any resolution flags. This allows the software to dynamically find optimal settings for your situation.

:::note
Once the stream starts, the resolution remains constant.

## Configuring Resolution

Moonbeam offers several approaches to set and constrain resolution:

### 2. Constraining Resolution Range with `--max-resolution` and `--min-resolution`

These options let you define the range of resolutions that Moonbeam will consider during connection analysis:

```bash
moonbeam --max-resolution 1920x1080 --min-resolution 1280x720 stream MyHost "My Game"
```

This command allows Moonbeam to set the resolution between 720p and 1080p based on initial network conditions.

### 2a. Setting a Specific Resolution with `--resolution`

To set a fixed resolution, use the `--resolution` option:

```bash
moonbeam --resolution 1920x1080 stream MyHost "My Game"
```

This setting is equivalent to the resolution option in the standard Moonlight client. It sets both the minimum and maximum resolution to the specified value.


### 2b. Using Shorthand Resolution Options

Moonbeam provides convenient shorthand options for common resolutions:

```bash
moonbeam --720p stream MyHost "My Game"
```

Available shorthand options include:
- `--360p` (640x360)
- `--480p` (854x480)
- `--540p` (960x540)
- `--720p` (1280x720)
- `--900p` (1600x900)
- `--1080p` (1920x1080)
- `--1440p` (2560x1440)
- `--2K` (2048x1080)
- `--4K` (3840x2160)

:::note
When using shorthand options, similar to `--resolution` both the maximum and minimum resolution are set to the specified value.
:::

## Fine-tuning Resolution Scaling Steps

The `--resolution-steps` option allows for more granular control over resolution optimization:

```bash
moonbeam --max-resolution 1920x1080 --min-resolution 1280x720 --resolution-steps 5 stream MyHost "My Game"
```

This option determines the number of intermediate resolutions Moonbeam will consider. Here's an example of the resolutions that might be considered:

1. 1280x720
2. 1440x810
3. 1600x900
4. 1760x990
5. 1920x1080

:::tip
The default value is 9, which works well for most scenarios. Adjust this value based on your specific needs and network conditions.
:::

## Resolution Priority

The `--priority resolution` option instructs Moonbeam to favor resolution over frame rate when determining optimal streaming settings. Before starting the stream, Moonbeam calculates bandwidth requirements for various resolutions at different frame rates, selecting the best combination your network can support.

For example:

```bash
moonbeam --priority resolution --max-resolution 4K --max-fps 120 stream MyHost "My Game"
```

With this configuration, Moonbeam will consider the bandwidth needed for various frame rates at a 4K resolution before choosing a FPS & resolution combo.

:::note
For more detailed information about priority settings, including how to balance resolution and FPS priorities, please refer to the [Priority Settings](./4-5-priority-settings) page.

## Best Practices for Resolution Configuration

1. **Match Your Display**: Set the maximum resolution to match your display's native resolution for the best visual quality.

2. **Consider Your Network**:
   - For stable, high-bandwidth connections: Consider using higher resolutions for improved visual clarity.
   - For low-bandwidth or high-latency connections: Use a lower resolution range (e.g., `--max-resolution 1080p --min-resolution 720p`) or omit resolution flags to allow automatic adjustment.

3. **Flexible Resolution Range**: Using a wide resolution range allows Moonbeam to find the ideal setting. For unstable connections, consider omitting resolution constraints entirely.

4. **Balance Resolution and FPS**: Higher resolutions require more bandwidth. Adjust both resolution and FPS based on your game's needs and network capacity.

5. **Performance Considerations**: For demanding games, you might want to cap the maximum resolution lower than your display's native resolution to maintain high frame rates.

:::caution
Setting a resolution higher than your display's native resolution provides no visible benefit and may waste bandwidth. In such cases, Moonbeam will likely automatically reduce the resolution to match your current display's resolution.
:::

:::important
All resolution settings are fixed once the stream starts. To change settings, you must disconnect and reconnect.

By understanding and utilizing these resolution settings, you can effectively optimize Moonlight's behavior for Moonbeam across various network conditions and game types. Experiment to find the best balance for your specific setup and preferences.
