# Glossary of Terms

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used in Moonbeam and game streaming in general. Understanding these terms will help you better navigate the Moonbeam documentation and optimize your streaming experience.

## A

### Auto Mode
The default operating mode of Moonbeam where it automatically determines the optimal streaming settings based on your network conditions and system capabilities.

### AV1
An open, royalty-free video coding format designed for video transmissions over the Internet. It provides better compression than H.264 and HEVC.

## B

### Bitrate
The amount of data transferred per second, typically measured in kilobits per second (Kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps). Higher bitrates generally result in better video quality but require more bandwidth.

## F

### FPS (Frames Per Second)
The frequency at which consecutive images (frames) are displayed in an animated display. Higher FPS generally results in smoother motion.

## H

### H.264
Also known as Advanced Video Coding (AVC), it's a video compression standard widely used for recording, compression, and distribution of video content.

### HDR (High Dynamic Range)
A technique used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity than is possible with standard digital imaging or photographic techniques.

### HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)
Also known as H.265, it's a video compression standard that offers about double the data compression ratio at the same level of video quality compared to H.264.

## L

### Latency
The delay between an input being processed and the corresponding output. In game streaming, it refers to the delay between a user's action and the visible result on the screen.

## M

### Moonbeam
A tool that auto-configures Moonlight for optimal performance on Linux devices, adjusting settings based on network conditions and device capabilities.

### Moonlight
An open source implementation of NVIDIA's GameStream protocol, allowing you to stream your PC games to other devices.

## N

### NVIDIA GameStream
A proprietary protocol developed by NVIDIA for streaming games from a GeForce GTX-powered PC to other devices.

## R

### Resolution
The number of distinct pixels in each dimension that can be displayed. Common resolutions include 1920x1080 (1080p), 2560x1440 (1440p), and 3840x2160 (4K).

## S

### Streaming Host
The computer that runs the game or application being streamed. In the context of Moonbeam, this is typically a PC with an NVIDIA GPU.

### Sunshine
An open-source implementation of NVIDIA GameStream, allowing AMD and Intel GPUs to act as streaming hosts for Moonlight clients.

## V

### V-Sync (Vertical Synchronization)
A graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of a game with the refresh rate of the monitor. It can help prevent screen tearing but may introduce input lag.

### Video Codec
Software or hardware that compresses and decompresses digital video. Common codecs include H.264, HEVC, and AV1.

## W

### Wayland
A protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, aiming to replace the X Window System.

## X

### X11 (X Window System)
A windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.
