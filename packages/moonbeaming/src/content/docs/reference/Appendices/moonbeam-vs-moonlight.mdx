## When to Choose Moonbeam

:::tip[Ideal for Linux Nomads]
Moonbeam shines brightest for Linux users who frequently change their networking environment or use portable devices with varying system capabilities.
:::

Choose Moonbeam over standard Moonlight when you:

- Want a hassle-free, optimized streaming experience on Linux
- Frequently switch between different networks or connection types
- Use a portable Linux device with varying system resources
- Need more granular control over streaming parameters
- Desire better integration with Linux-specific display servers and tools

## When to Stick with Standard Moonlight

While Moonbeam offers numerous advantages, there might be scenarios where standard Moonlight is preferable:

- You're using a non-Linux platform
- You require a feature that's only available in the standard Moonlight client
- You prefer a graphical user interface over command-line operations

:::caution[Compatibility Note]
Moonbeam uses the same underlying protocols as Moonlight, so you can easily switch between the two without reconfiguring your host PC.
:::

By leveraging the strengths of Moonlight while adding Linux-specific optimizations and automatic adaptations, Moonbeam provides a superior streaming experience for Linux users, especially those with varying usage scenarios or network conditions.
