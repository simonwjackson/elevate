Moonbeam, being fully compatible with Moonlight, can be integrated with various tools to create a more tailored streaming setup. This section covers several examples of such integrations, demonstrating Moonbeam's flexibility and backwards compatibility with Moonlight.

## Gamescope Integration

Gamescope, a micro-compositing window manager, can be particularly useful when streaming games. For Moonbeam (and Moonlight) users, its primary benefit is the upscaling technology it provides.

<Steps>

1. Install Gamescope:

   <Tabs syncKey="os">
   <TabItem label="Nix">
   ```bash
   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gamescope
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Ubuntu">
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:kisak/kisak-mesa
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install gamescope
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Arch">
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S gamescope
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Fedora">
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install gamescope
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Use Gamescope with Moonbeam:

   ```bash
   gamescope -f -F fsr -- moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-resolution 720p --max-fps 120 --priority fps
   ```

   This command launches your stream in a Gamescope window with FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) upscaling enabled. The double dash (`--`) separates Gamescope options from the Moonbeam command, ensuring each application correctly interprets its own options.

</Steps>

:::tip
Gamescope can help improve visual quality when streaming at lower resolutions, thanks to its upscaling capabilities.

## Gamemode Integration

Gamemode is a daemon that can optimize your system for gaming. While primarily designed for local gaming, it can potentially benefit streaming setups as well.

<Steps>

1. Install Gamemode:

   <Tabs syncKey="os">
   <TabItem label="Nix">
   ```bash
   nix-env -iA nixpkgs.gamemode
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Ubuntu">
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gamemode
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Arch">
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S gamemode
   ```
   </TabItem>
   <TabItem label="Fedora">
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install gamemode
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

2. Use Gamemode with Moonbeam:

   ```bash
   gamemoderun moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>
   ```

   This command applies Gamemode optimizations while running your Moonbeam stream.

</Steps>

:::caution
Gamemode may conflict with some power management tools. Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility with your system.

## Integration with Desktop Environments

You can create desktop shortcuts or menu entries for quick access to your favorite games through Moonbeam. This method works for both Moonbeam and standard Moonlight.

Create a `.desktop` file in `~/.local/share/applications/`:

```ini
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Stream Game
Exec=moonbeam stream <HOST> "My Favorite Game"
Type=Application
Categories=Game;
```

This creates a menu entry that launches your specified game through Moonbeam when clicked.

:::note
Replace `<HOST>` and `"My Favorite Game"` with your actual host and game name.
