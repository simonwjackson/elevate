## Scripting with Moonbeam

You can create shell scripts that use Moonbeam to automate various aspects of your streaming setup. Here are several creative examples:

### Time-based streaming profile

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# time_based_streaming.sh
current_hour=$(date +%H)

if (( current_hour >= 22 || current_hour < 6 )); then
  # Night mode: lower brightness, warmer colors
  moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> --max-resolution 720p --fps 30 --extra-moonlight-options "--contrast -10 --saturation 80"
else
  # Day mode: standard settings
  moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>
fi
```

This script adjusts streaming settings based on the time of day, potentially reducing eye strain during night hours.

### Multi-game launcher

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# multi_game_launcher.sh
games=("Game 1" "Game 2" "Game 3" "Game 4")

echo "Select a game to launch:"
select game in "${games[@]}"; do
  case $game in
    "Game 1") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 1" --priority resolution ;;
    "Game 2") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 2" --priority fps --max-fps 120 ;;
    "Game 3") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 3" --max-resolution 4K --fps 60 ;;
    "Game 4") moonbeam stream <HOST> "Game 4" ;;
    *) echo "Invalid selection" ;;
  esac
  break
done
```

This script presents a menu of games, each with customized streaming settings.

### Conditional Streaming Settings

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# adaptive-moonbeam.sh
HOST="my-gaming-pc"
APP="$1"

# Check if we're on battery power
on_battery() {
    cat /sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/status | grep -q "Discharging"
}

# Set streaming options based on power status
if on_battery; then
    OPTIONS="--max-resolution 720p --max-fps 30 --max-bitrate 5000"
else
    OPTIONS="--max-resolution 1080p --max-fps 60 --max-bitrate 20000"
fi

moonbeam stream "$HOST" "$APP" $OPTIONS
```

This script adjusts streaming quality based on whether the device is running on battery power.

## Advanced Integration Examples

Here are some more advanced integration examples that showcase Moonbeam's versatility:

### Game Streaming Session Time Tracker and Limiter

This script uses the `timewarrior` time tracking tool to monitor your gaming sessions and limit them to a specified duration.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# game_session_tracker.sh
MAX_SESSION_TIME=120 # Maximum session time in minutes

start_time=$(date +%s)

# Start time tracking
timew start "Gaming Session"

# Start the game stream
moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP> &
pid=$!

while true; do
    current_time=$(date +%s)
    elapsed_time=$((current_time - start_time))
    
    if [ $elapsed_time -ge $((MAX_SESSION_TIME * 60)) ]; then
        echo "Session time limit reached. Stopping the stream."
        kill $pid
        break
    fi
    
    sleep 60 # Check every minute
done

# Stop time tracking
timew stop

echo "Gaming session ended. Total time: $(timew summary)"
```

To use this script:

1. Install timewarrior: `sudo apt install timewarrior` (or equivalent for your distribution)
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x game_session_tracker.sh`
3. Run the script: `./game_session_tracker.sh`

This script will start a Moonbeam stream, track the session time using timewarrior, and automatically stop the stream after the specified time limit.

### Moonbeam Integration with Home Automation Systems

This example integrates Moonbeam with Home Assistant, a popular home automation platform, to control your gaming environment.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# gaming_environment.sh
HASS_URL="http://homeassistant.local:8123"
HASS_TOKEN="your_long_lived_access_token"

# Function to call Home Assistant API
call_hass_service() {
    curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $HASS_TOKEN" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
         -d "$2" \
         "$HASS_URL/api/services/$1"
}

# Set up gaming environment
call_hass_service "light/turn_on" '{"entity_id": "light.gaming_room", "brightness": 128, "rgb_color": [255,0,0]}'
call_hass_service "climate/set_temperature" '{"entity_id": "climate.gaming_room", "temperature": 22}'

# Start the game stream
moonbeam stream <HOST> <APP>

# Reset environment after gaming
call_hass_service "light/turn_on" '{"entity_id": "light.gaming_room", "brightness": 255, "rgb_color": [255,255,255]}'
call_hass_service "climate/set_temperature" '{"entity_id": "climate.gaming_room", "temperature": 24}'
```

This script adjusts your room's lighting and temperature before starting a game stream, and resets them after you're done gaming.

### Voice-Controlled Game Streaming Assistant

This example uses the `speech_recognition` Python library to create a voice-controlled interface for Moonbeam.

First, install the required Python library:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
```

Then, create the following Python script:

```python
# voice_controlled_moonbeam.py
import speech_recognition as sr
import subprocess

def run_moonbeam(command):
    subprocess.run(f"moonbeam {command}", shell=True)

r = sr.Recognizer()

print("Voice-controlled Moonbeam Assistant. Say 'start game' to begin streaming.")

while True:
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = r.listen(source)
    
    try:
        command = r.recognize_google(audio).lower()
        print(f"You said: {command}")

        if "start game" in command:
            print("Starting game stream...")
            run_moonbeam("stream <HOST> '<GAME>'")
        elif "stop stream" in command:
            print("Stopping stream...")
            run_moonbeam("quit")
        elif "exit" in command:
            print("Exiting voice control...")
            break
        else:
            print("Command not recognized. Try again.")
    
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results; {e}")
```

To use this voice-controlled assistant:

1. Make sure you have a working microphone.
2. Run the script: `python voice_controlled_moonbeam.py`
3. Speak commands like "start game" or "stop stream" to control Moonbeam.

:::caution
This script requires an internet connection for speech recognition. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and consider the privacy implications of using cloud-based speech recognition.
:::

These advanced integration examples demonstrate how Moonbeam can be incorporated into larger systems and controlled through various interfaces, enhancing the overall gaming experience and integrating it with other aspects of your digital life.

By leveraging these integrations and scripting techniques, you can create a more customized and efficient game streaming setup, tailored to your specific needs and preferences. Remember, these methods demonstrate Moonbeam's compatibility with existing Moonlight setups and tools.
