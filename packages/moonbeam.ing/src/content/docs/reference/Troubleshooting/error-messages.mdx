Moonbeam provides various error messages to help you identify and resolve issues. This section will help you understand common error messages and provide guidance on how to address them.

### Connection Errors

1. **"Failed to connect to host"**

   This error occurs when Moonbeam cannot establish a connection with the specified host.

   ```bash
   Error: Failed to connect to host MyPC
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Check if the host name or IP address is correct.
   2. Ensure the host computer is powered on and running Sunshine.
   3. Verify that both client and host are on the same network.
   4. Check your firewall settings on both the host and client.

   </Steps>

2. **"Unable to pair with host"**

   This error appears when Moonbeam can't complete the pairing process with the host.

   ```bash
   Error: Unable to pair with host. PIN may be incorrect.
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Double-check the PIN you entered.
   2. Ensure Sunshine is running and accepting connections on the host.
   3. Try restarting both Moonbeam and Sunshine.

   </Steps>

### Network Errors

1. **"Network test failed"**

   This error indicates that Moonbeam couldn't complete its network speed test.

   ```bash
   Error: Network test failed. Unable to determine optimal settings.
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Check your internet connection.
   2. Ensure the iperf3 server is running on the host (port 31347).
   3. Verify that your firewall isn't blocking the iperf3 connection.

   </Steps>

2. **"Latency exceeds maximum allowed"**

   This error occurs when the measured latency is higher than the specified maximum.

   ```bash
   Error: Measured latency (50ms) exceeds maximum allowed (30ms). Aborting.
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Check your network conditions and try to reduce latency.
   2. Consider increasing the `--max-latency` value if your use case allows for higher latency.
   3. Try using a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi.

   </Steps>

### Configuration Errors

1. **"Invalid resolution format"**

   This error appears when an incorrect resolution format is provided.

   ```bash
   Error: Invalid resolution format. Please use WxH (e.g., 1920x1080).
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Ensure you're using the correct format (width x height).
   2. Check that both width and height are positive integers.
   3. Use one of the predefined resolution options (e.g., `--1080p`) if unsure.

   </Steps>

2. **"Incompatible options"**

   This error occurs when mutually exclusive options are used together.

   ```bash
   Error: Incompatible options: --max-resolution cannot be used with --resolution
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Review your command and remove one of the conflicting options.
   2. Refer to the Moonbeam documentation for correct option usage.

   </Steps>

### Runtime Errors

1. **"Unable to start stream"**

   This error indicates that Moonbeam couldn't initiate the streaming session.

   ```bash
   Error: Unable to start stream. Check if the application is running on the host.
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Verify that the specified application or game is installed and running on the host.
   2. Check Sunshine logs on the host for any errors.
   3. Ensure the host system meets the requirements for game streaming.

   </Steps>

2. **"Stream disconnected unexpectedly"**

   This error appears when an active stream is suddenly terminated.

   ```bash
   Error: Stream disconnected unexpectedly. Attempting to reconnect...
   ```

   <Steps>
   
   1. Check your network connection for any interruptions.
   2. Verify that the host computer hasn't gone to sleep or shut down.
   3. If the `--reconnect` option is enabled, Moonbeam will attempt to reestablish the connection automatically.

   </Steps>

:::tip
When troubleshooting, always check the Moonbeam log file (default location: `/tmp/moonbeam.log`) for more detailed error information. You can increase the verbosity of logs using the `--log-level` option.
:::

### Debug Mode Errors

When running Moonbeam with the `--debug` option, you may see more detailed error messages:

1. **"Failed to measure network speed"**

   ```bash
   DEBUG: Failed to measure network speed to host. Using estimated bitrate.
   ```

   This message indicates that the iperf3 speed test couldn't be completed. Moonbeam will fall back to estimated values based on resolution and FPS.

2. **"Unable to detect display refresh rate"**

   ```bash
   DEBUG: Unable to detect display refresh rate. Using default value of 60Hz.
   ```

   This message appears when Moonbeam can't determine your display's refresh rate. It will use a safe default value.

:::caution
While debug mode provides more information, it may also expose sensitive data. Be cautious when sharing debug logs and ensure to redact any private information.

By understanding these error messages, you can more effectively troubleshoot issues with Moonbeam and ensure a smoother streaming experience. If you encounter persistent errors or issues not covered here, consider reaching out to the Moonbeam community for support.
