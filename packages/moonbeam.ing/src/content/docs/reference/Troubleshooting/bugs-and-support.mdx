<Steps>

   Collect relevant information about your setup:
   - Moonbeam version
   - Host and client operating systems and versions
   - Network setup (e.g., Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
   - Any relevant hardware details

3. **Enable Debug Mode**

5. **Fill Out the Bug Report**

   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Screenshots or videos (if applicable)

6. **Submit and Follow Up**
   
   Submit the bug report and stay responsive to any questions or requests for additional information from the developers.

### Best Practices for Seeking Help

When seeking support, follow these best practices to get the most helpful responses:

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe your problem or question. Vague inquiries are difficult to answer.

2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details about your setup, what you've already tried, and any error messages you've encountered.

3. **Use Proper Formatting**: When sharing code or logs, use appropriate formatting (such as code blocks) to make it readable.

4. **Be Patient and Polite**: Remember that many community members are volunteers offering their time to help.

5. **Pay It Forward**: As you become more experienced with Moonbeam, consider helping others with their questions.

:::tip
If you're reporting a security vulnerability, please do not post it publicly. Instead, follow the security policy outlined in the Moonbeam repository to report it privately to the maintainers.

By following these guidelines for reporting bugs and seeking support, you'll not only get help more quickly but also contribute to improving Moonbeam for all users. Remember, a well-documented issue or question is much easier for the community to assist with and resolve.
